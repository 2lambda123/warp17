### Who's A Rapid Packet generator?

Lightweight solution for generating high volumes of session-based traffic with
high setup rates. The project emerged from the need
of having an easy to configure and use, open stateful traffic generator
that would run on commodity hardware.

### Performance benchmarks

A peek at _WARP17_'s performances shows that it easily reaches line rate of
40Gbps with:

* TCP setup rates of __6.8M sessions/sec__
* HTTP setup rates of __3.6M sessions/sec__ with continuous bidirectional traffic
* UDP rates between __20M pkts/sec__ and __45M pkts/sec__

For details see the [Benchmarks Section](https://github.com/Juniper/warp17/blob/master/README.md#performance-benchmarks) in
the documentation.
